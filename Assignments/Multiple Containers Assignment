# Run a Nginx, Mysql and Apache (http) web server.

# Run All of them and --detach or -d; name them with --name

# Nginx should listen on 80:80, httpd on 8080:80, mysql on 3306:3306

# When running Mysql, use the --env option (or -e) to pass in MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes

# Use Docker container logs on mysql to find random password it created at startup.

# Clean it All up with 'docker container stop' and 'docker container rm'

# Use 'docker container ls' to make sure it is correct before and after clean up.
